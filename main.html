		<li>To reduce the time taken to run a program, we can optimize it by:

Algorithm Optimization: Choosing more efficient algorithms, such as O(1) instead of O(n) for data manipulation.
Code Optimization: Eliminating unnecessary loops or redundant computations.
Parallel Processing: Utilizing parallelism to distribute tasks, reducing runtime.
Memory Optimization: Using space-efficient data structures and techniques like compression or in-place updates.
Caching: Storing intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations.
Profiling and Debugging: Identifying and fixing bottlenecks through profiling tools.
Increasing space occupied can be achieved by:

Caching: Storing more data in memory to reduce recomputation.
Increased Precision: Storing additional data like larger numbers or more decimal places.
Data Structures: Using complex structures like trees or graphs, which occupy more memory.
Optimization Techniques: Balancing between time and space efficiency depending on the use case.</li>
		<li>To reduce memory usage while maintaining runtime:

Optimize Data Structures: Use space-efficient structures like arrays over lists.
Garbage Collection: Ensure efficient memory management through garbage collection.
Memory Pools: Allocate memory in chunks instead of repeatedly requesting memory from the OS.
These strategies help balance memory and runtime efficiency.</li>
		<li>Reducing both time and space complexity can be achieved by deploying relevant algorithms. By selecting efficient algorithms, such as those with lower time complexity (e.g., O(log n), O(1)) and space complexity (e.g., constant or logarithmic space), the overall performance improves. For example, sorting algorithms like QuickSort or MergeSort can handle large datasets efficiently with better time and space optimization. Additionally, algorithms like Dynamic Programming optimize memory usage through memoization or tabulation techniques. Minimizing redundant computations and efficiently managing resources ensures that both time and space complexities are reduced simultaneously,
			leading to a more efficient program.</li>
